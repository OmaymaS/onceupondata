A couple of weeks ago, I gave my first talk in a data science/rstats conference; [Fitting Humans Stories in List Columns: Cases from an Online Recruitment Platform](https://speakerdeck.com/omaymas/fitting-humans-stories-in-list-columns-erum). It was at [EARL Boston](https://earlconf.com/boston/) and it was a good experience as I received positive feedback from the attendees. I intended to write about the story I shared in my talk. But then I recalled [Emily Robinson's](https://twitter.com/robinson_es) post [Giving Your First Data Science Talk](https://robinsones.github.io/Giving-Your-First-Data-Science-Talk/), published last July. And I though about writing about my own experience and how the rstats community provided support.

## Why to give a talk in the first place?

People have different reasons to give talks. For me the main motives are:

1- I currently work in a city with a relatively small rstats and data science community. There are very few meetups, and consequently, rare opportunities to meet a diverse community, share knowledge and get exposed to new stuff. So going to conferences, *even if I have to fly a long distance*, has a significant added value.

2- I like to share and contribute to the rstats community, and that's why I started my blog mid 2016. Because it is a mutual benefit, where my content might help the beginners and others' feedback definitely helps me see where I am and what I could improve. So a meetup/conference talk is a different form of sharing, while getting instant feedback.

3- I could see a story to tell about my work and how certain framework/tools like the `tidyverse` empowers me to do effective data analysis, with a level of flexibility that helps me look beyond summary statistics and shallow correlations. So I wanted to communicate this and see how it will be perceived. 

## But How was the experience of submitting abstracts?

First of all I'd like to point out that I got **THREE** rejected submissions in 2017 before getting **THREE** accepted abstracts in the same year. And I have to say that these rejections were valuable, because they helped me debug my work, reach out to more people from the community for feedback and definitely improve my submissions. 

**The THREE rejected submissions:**

- A lightning talk at **Rstudio::conf 2017**, and I admit it was not that good compared to the accepted.

- A talk at [**UseR! 2017**](https://user2017.brussels/), and after attending the newbie session, where [Heather Turner](https://twitter.com/HeathrTurnr) talked about their selection criteria, I could see the areas of improvement in my abstract.

- A talk at [**EARL London 2017**](https://earlconf.com/london/). After asking for feedback, I could see how I was supposed to rewrite the abstract.


**The THREE accepted submissions:**

- A talk at [**EARL Boston 2017**](https://earlconf.com/boston/) which I already gave.

- A talk at [**Budapest BI Forum**](http://budapestbiforum.hu/2017/en/), but unfortunately I couldn't make it due to my work schedule :(.

- A poster at [**Rstudio::conf 2018**](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/), but unfortunately won't be able to make it for logistical reasons :(. 

## So how did the rstats community help?

While writing my first three submissions, I haven't asked others to review them. Maybe I thought they were ok, or I didn't know whom should I ask!. But when I went to UseR! conference, I met many people from the community, especially from [Rladies](https://rladies.org/) who offered to read my abstract and advise me. 

When I went back, I rewrote the abstract and shared with several people for review. And I have to say that they helped me look to what I've written from a different perspective, and reformulate it. On top of the reviewers were [Charlotte Wickham](https://twitter.com/CVWickham) and [Maëlle Salmon](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon). But I also got other reviewers like [Emily Riederer](https://twitter.com/EmilyRiederer) who reached out to me to exchange reviews about our abstracts, since she was also submitting one *(Don't miss her talk at Rstudio::conf!)*. Also [Steph Locke](https://twitter.com/SteffLocke) connected to me through Rladies initiative for abstract review, and [Agnes Salanki](https://twitter.com/salankia) gave me some comments.

All that showed how a supportive community can make a difference and help more people get engaged.

## But what about Preparing and giving a talk?

So as my abstract got accepted, I first had to make the hard choice of picking one of the conferences *(EARL and Budapest BI Forum)*, because both were in November. So I had to review my work schedule and I picked EARL. Then I started to finalize the slides and rehearse. But during this phase, I had sometimes where I questioned whether the talk would resonate with the audience, and whether they'd find a value in it. But I reminded myself of what **Emily Robinson** said in her post:

> "You probably have more to offer than you think"

or what [**David Robinson**](https://twitter.com/drob) says about the value of anything shared Vs. anything still on my computer.

So I moved on, and since i had to submit it a week before the conference, I had time to rehearse and share with a couple of colleagues who also gave some comments regarding the story, slides and flow. But I haven't promoted my talk since I don't feel comfortable doing so, I just wrote that I'll be speaking at EARL. But [Maëlle Salmon](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon), [Emily Riederer](https://twitter.com/EmilyRiederer), and [Rladies](https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal) advertised my talk, although they haven't seen any previous talks by me. And then came the day of the talk where things went well. People connected to what I was saying and I got positive feedback.

**So this was my journey to the first talk, and I hope more people contribute to the community and write similar posts *(as I was inspired by Emily Robinson's)*. Because usually the beginners see the final result; a speaker on the stage without the history of trials, the abstract drafts that were thrown away, the anxiety that kicks in, and all what's behind the scenes!**
