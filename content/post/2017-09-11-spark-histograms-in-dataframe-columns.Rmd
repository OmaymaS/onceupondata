```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = F, message = F, comment ="")
```

A couple of weeks ago, I was looking for a package I previously passed by that prints summary statistics with inline histograms. I checked all my bookmarks and likes on twitter, but I couldn't find it out! So I asked on twitter. fortunately **[MaÃ«lle Salmon](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon)** read the tweet and guided me to [`skimr`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/skimr) by [ropenscilabs](https://github.com/ropenscilabs).

So basically 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
books <- read_csv("../../static/data/books.csv")
head(books)
```
