```


A couple of months ago, Tidy eval was something that I passed by, but didn't have time to explore. As usual, sometimes one gets busy with the daily work, and puts some stuff aside to come back to. However, I like to find ways that give me a higher level of flexibility and more control. So mid June, I had an inquiry regarding programming around dplyr. I wasn't sure how to pass a variable column names to `purrr::map`, so I opened an issue; [purrr::map() support for SE/variable column names?](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/issues/339).

[Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) and [Lionel Henry](https://github.com/lionel-) guided me to different ways to approach the problem, mentioning **[Tidyeval](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rlang/vignettes/tidy-evaluation.html)**. So it was time I got to know it for real. I have to say that I am still exploring its capabilities and use cases, but this post is about my first steps!


### What I Wanted to Do

What led me to Tidy eval was the the desire to prgram around dplyr. The example I shared in the issue was having a list column `Tags_terms` in a dataframe `dat_r`, that I wanted to mutate with the count of tags in each row. Pretty simple!

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)

dat_r <- tribble(
  ~ Tags_terms,
  c("R", "ggplot2","dplyr"),
  "tidyverse",
  c("dplyr", "lubridate")
)

```

The straightforward way was:

```{r}
dat_r %>% 
  mutate(tags_count = map_int(Tags_terms, length))
```

### Which Limitations I Faced 

However, I wanted to be able to pass the column as a variable, because it could be `Tags_terms` or any other name. Moreover, I wanted to have the option of wrapping this into a function. So I wondered whether there was a way to achieve this.
Definitely I knew that doing something like the following was not the right thing. The column name would not be seen. Instead, `cname` would be seen as a character vector with 1 element!

```{r}
cname <- "Tags_terms"
dat_r %>% 
  mutate(tags_count = map_int(cname, length))
```

### How Tidy eval Helped Me

At this point, I opened the issue and one of the suggestion was to use  **`quo`** which *"quotes its input rather than evaluating it"* then `!!` to unquote the input to be evaluated. This seems confusing at the beginning, but let's see how it works!

As we can see, `cname` quotes the input `Tags_terms` and returns a `quosure` *(a special type of formula)*. Then it gets unquoted using `!!`, and that's how we get the desired result.

```{r}
cname <- quo(Tags_terms)
print(cname)
```


```{r}
dat_r %>% 
  mutate(tags_count = map_int(!!cname, length))
```

#### Turning the code into a function

Having this kind of flexibility, we can create general functions like `add_tag_count` to reuse for the same purpose. But inside a function, we use **`enquo`** which *"sees what the user typed, and returns that value as a quosure"*.

```{r}
add_tag_count <- function(x, cname){
  
  cname <- enquo(cname)

  x %>% 
    mutate(tags_count = map_int(!!cname, length))
}
```
So here we can see how it works properly with `dat_books`.

```{r}
dat_books <- tribble(
  ~ genre,
  c("fiction", "comedy"),
  c("tragedy", "fiction", "fantasy"),
  c("satire", "tragedy")
)

add_tag_count(dat_books, genre)
```

#### Varying the name of the output variable

In the previous function, the new column will always be called `tags_count`. What if we wanted to call it `genre_count` in the `dat_books` example, or any other arbitrary name? 

We need to do the following:

- Use `quo_name()` to convert the input expression to string

- Use `:=` helper provided by `rlang`


```{r}
add_tag_count <- function(x, cname, count_col){
  
  cname <- enquo(cname)
  
  count_col <- enquo(count_col)
  count_col_name <- quo_name(count_col)

  x %>% 
    mutate(!!count_col_name := map_int(!!cname, length))
}
```

And now we can pass both the list column name `genre`, and the desired output name `genre_count`.

```{r}
add_tag_count(dat_books, genre, genre_count)
```


## Other Examples using Tidy eval

After getting acquainted with Tidy eval, I had other situations when I wanted to to write general functions to avoid repetition. So here are two examples:


### Example 1 : Capturing multiple variables

Here I wanted to write a function that:

- takes multiple columns

- group_by the given columns

- provides the count of each group and the percentage *(if TRUE)*, descendingly ordered 


So to capture multiple variables, we can:

- use **`quos()x`** to capture all the ... as a list of formulas.

- use **`!!!`** to splice the arguments into **`group_by()`**


```{r}
freq_tbl <- function(df, ..., percent = TRUE, freq){
  group <- quos(...)
  
  out <- df %>% 
    group_by(!!!group) %>% 
    summarise(freq = n()) %>% 
    arrange(desc(freq)) %>% 
    ungroup()
  
  if(percent == TRUE){
    out <- out %>% 
      mutate(percentage = 100*freq/sum(freq))
  }
  return(out)
}
```

Now we can use it with any number of variables. For instance, if we use `starwars` dataset, we pass any number of columns.  

Here we pass `homeworld` & `species` to group by.

```{r}
starwars_gp2 <- starwars %>% 
  freq_tbl(homeworld, species, percent = F)

head(starwars_gp2)
```
Similarly, we can simply add `gender` or any other column.

```{r}
starwars_gp3 <- starwars %>% 
  freq_tbl(homeworld, species, gender) 
head(starwars_gp3)
```


### Example 2: Ngrams Table

In this case, I wanted to create unigrams. bigrams and trigrams tables with counts In the normal case, this means writing identical lines three times *(as shown below)*, with minor changes in the type of ngrams, and the name of the output columns.

```{r}
library(tidytext)
library(janeaustenr)


# unigram table
unigrams <- data_frame(txt = prideprejudice) %>%
  unnest_tokens(ngram, txt, token = "ngrams", n = 1) %>% 
  rename(unigram = ngram) %>% 
  group_by(unigram) %>% 
  summarise(unigram_freq = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(unigram_freq))

# bigram table
bigrams <- data_frame(txt = prideprejudice) %>%
  unnest_tokens(ngram, txt, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>% 
  rename(bigram = ngram) %>% 
  group_by(bigram) %>% 
  summarise(bigram_freq = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(bigram_freq))

# bigram table
trigram <- data_frame(txt = prideprejudice) %>%
  unnest_tokens(ngram, txt, token = "ngrams", n = 3) %>% 
  rename(trigram = ngram) %>% 
  group_by(trigram) %>% 
  summarise(trigram_freq = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(trigram_freq))

```

**So how can we wrap this into a general function?**

Ideally, we would like to write a function that takes:

- `n` : the type of ngram

- `gram_col` : the name of the ngram column

- `freq_col` : the name of the ngram count column

And this can be achieved as follows:

```{r}
create_gram_table <- function(input_txt, n, gram_col, freq_col){
  
  gram_col <- enquo(gram_col)
  gram_col_name <- quo_name(gram_col)
  
  freq_col <- enquo(freq_col)
  freq_col_name <- quo_name(freq_col)
  
  x <- data_frame(txt = input_txt)
  
  g <- tidytext::unnest_tokens(x, ngram, txt,
                               token = "ngrams", n = n) %>%
    rename(!!gram_col_name := ngram) %>%
    group_by(!!gram_col) %>%
    summarise(!!freq_col_name := n()) %>%
    arrange(desc( !!freq_col))
  
  return(g)
}

```

So now instead of the duplication, we can use `create_gram_table`, which gives us the desired output with less repetition.

```{r}
create_gram_table(prideprejudice, 1, unigram, unigram_freq) %>% head
create_gram_table(prideprejudice, 2, bigram, bigram_freq) %>% head
create_gram_table(prideprejudice, 3, trigram, trigram_freq) %>% head
```


## Tidy eval & ggplot2

After using tidy eval in some examples, I thought it would be great to have it with `ggplot2`. So I tried it but it didn't work. I didn't know whether I was missing something or they were not compatible yet. I [asked](https://twitter.com/OmaymaS_/status/887329478669729793) to find out, and the answer was that `ggplot2` was planned to be ported to tidy eval within months. So I am looking forward!

## Conclusion

**So those were my first steps in the world of the Tidy eval. I like how it gives me more control and flexibility, yet I am still learning and grasping its capabilities. I am not sure if all what I am doing adheres to the best practices, so I'll keep learning about it. And I'd be grateful to receive any feedback regarding the use cases I showed and better ways to handle them**
