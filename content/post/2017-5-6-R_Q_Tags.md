title: R Questions Tag Pairs on Stackoverflow 
date: 2017-05-06

Months ago, I passed by [R Questions from Stack Overflow](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/rquestions) published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). I was interested in tag pairs in particular, *i.e. which tags appear together in R questions*, so I worked on this simple [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/omaymas/tag-pairs-frequency-r-questions).

This week, I had some time so I thought about deploying a simple [Shiny App](https://omaymas.shinyapps.io/r-tags/), to give more people access to exploring the tag pairs. So here is the App, where you can see the most frequent tags that appear with a certain tag. And below is the full code of how I processed and aggregated the data.

## Data Aggregation

I selected the questions with **more than one tag** *(in addition to R)* and did the following:

- **Step 1**: get all the tags corresponding to question ID
- **Step 2**: find all pair combinations from these tags
- **Step 3**: combine all pairs from all the questions in one dataframe

### Step 1: get all the tags corresponding to question ID


```r
# group by question ID and nest tags
datn <- dat %>% 
  group_by(Id) %>% 
  filter(n()>1) %>% 
  nest(.key="Tags")
```

Now if we look at a certain question ID, we find all the tags in one list, for example for Q#79709

```
[[1]]
# A tibble: 4 × 1
               Tag
             <chr>
1           memory
2         function
3 global-variables
4     side-effects
```

### Step 2: find all  pair combinations from these tags

Now, we will get all the possible pairs from the questions' tags:


```r
# map each Tag list to combn() to get all the combinations from a list
datn <- datn %>% 
  mutate(pairs=map(Tags, ~combn(.x[["Tag"]], 2) %>% 
                     t %>% 
                     as.data.frame(stringsAsFactors = F)))
```

For the same question we checked in the previous step, we can see that the pairs are as follows:


```
[[1]]
                V1               V2
1           memory         function
2           memory global-variables
3           memory     side-effects
4         function global-variables
5         function     side-effects
6 global-variables     side-effects
```

### Step 3: combine all pairs from all the questions in one dataframe

Now we will combine all the pairs from all questions in one dataframe and count the freq of each pair:



```r
# combine all pairs in one dataframe
dat_pairs <- plyr::rbind.fill(datn$pairs)

# put pairs in the same order
dat_pairs <- dat_pairs %>% 
  mutate(firstV=map2_chr(V1,V2,function(x,y) sort(c(x,y))[1]),
         secondV=map2_chr(V1,V2,function(x,y) sort(c(x,y))[2])) %>% 
  select(-V1,-V2)

# count the frequency of each pair
pair_freq <- dat_pairs %>% 
  group_by(firstV,secondV) %>% 
  summarise(pair_count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pair_count)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Here we can see the top 10 pairs:

## Tag-Pairs for a Certain Tag

Here we can pick one tag and see all the other tags that appear with it and the frequency of each.


```r
# Get all pairs with a certain tag
GetTagPairs <- function(df, tag) {
  df %>% 
    filter(firstV==tag|secondV==tag) %>% 
    arrange(desc(pair_count)) %>% 
    mutate(T2 = ifelse(secondV==tag, firstV, secondV)) %>% 
    select(T2, pair_count)
}
```

### Example: ggplot2 Pairs

If we take **ggplot2** for example, we can see the most frequent tags that appeared with it as follows:


```r
ex <- GetTagPairs(pair_freq, "ggplot2")

head(ex,10)
```

```
# A tibble: 10 × 2
          T2 pair_count
       <chr>      <int>
1       plot       1628
2     legend        390
3  bar-chart        313
4    boxplot        288
5      shiny        275
6  histogram        262
7      facet        252
8     colors        211
9      ggmap        211
10     graph        204
```

**You can see the whole list for any tag in [Shiny App](#App).**

## In conclusion

Pair tags give us an idea about the areas of interest, the relations between topics/packages, and the frequently used packages in the R community. We can also draw a full network to visualize more complex relations. However, these were the tags in questions posted till *19 October 2016*. Definitely things change, and more tags get into the list with time. I personally expect that **Tidyverse** and its packages are mentioned more frequently in 2017. An updated dataset would help confirm this hypothesis!
