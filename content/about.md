I am Data Scientist with electrical engineering background. I like to engage with data, challenge assumptions and help others make data-informed decisions. For the last two years, I worked on developing algorithms and analyzing users data at a tech company providing a marketplace for jobs and career services. Prior to that I obtained my Master’s degree in “Systems Engineering and Engineering Management” with a focus on electronics where I worked with wearable sensors data. During my work I was involved in operations, engineering, R&D and data science roles which helps me see a holistic view of the projects I work on.
