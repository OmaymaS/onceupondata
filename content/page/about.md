I am Principal Data Scientist (Machine Learning) with electronics engineering background. I like to engage with data, build data products and help others make data-informed decisions. I always ask they whys and the why nots and I encourage others to question their assumptions. I care about algorithmic fairness and I try to trigger others to think about it. I am a certified instructor from different entities including [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and I enjoy teaching coding and data-science related skills.
